# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louise would like to start a crowd-funding campaign to fund her play, Fever. The budget for Louise\'92s campaign is over $10,000. This is the first time Louise will be funding a campaign, therefore, she has requested professional services to provide an analysis of  other crowd-funding data to determine whether there are specific factors that make a project's campaign successful to help Louis plan her own campaign and set it up for success.
 
### Purpose
By analyzing the data, I will be able to help Louise plan her own campaign and provide her with a greater understanding of campaign funding from start to finish. This will  help Louise mirror successful campaigns in the same category as hers.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

By looking at historical data of the month previous theater campaigns were launched, it was found that May is the month with the most successful launched campaigns. It is recommended that Louise launches the campaign for Fever during the month of May. It can also be noted that the months of May, June, July, August and October had roughly the same amount of failed campaigns launched.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
From the chart below we can see that the  plays with the most successful outcome have had a budget of less than $5,000. Since Louise\'92s play has a budget of over $10,000, if we focus on the $10,000 - $14,999 range, we can tell Louise her play most likely has a 54% chance of succeeding.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The main challenge I encountered while performing Louise\'92s analysis was working with the date formats in Excel. I was not able  to use the YEAR() function and had to use the Text(,\'94YYYY\'94) function to perform the analysis instead.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The best month to launch a crowd-funding theater campaign is May.
2. The worst month to launch a crowd-funding theater campaign is December.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Campaigns with a budget of $5,000 or less have a higher success rate.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

1. There isn't enough data about plays with a budget over $25,000.
2. The most recent data is from 2017 (four years old).

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. Average time a campaign is live.
2. Most successful category
3.Spotlight effect
4. Category with the most backers
5. Country with most successful launches.
